# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hassnaa Ait lachgar
🎓 I'm a freshman Computer Science student passionate about learning how things work behind the scenes — from software to systems. I love solving problems, exploring code, and building projects that make life easier (or more fun!).

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Python fundamentals and programming logic
- Basics of computer science and algorithms
- How to manage and contribute to GitHub projects

## 💻 Projects

I'm just getting started, but here are a few things I've worked on or am working on:

- 🖼️ **Gallery Hub** – A Python-based virtual art exhibition system with login, drawing, and ticket purchasing features
- 🎢 **Physics Playground Project** – A creative design using physics principles to model real-world playground equipment
- ✏️ Small Python games and mini tools (coming soon!)



## 📌 Goals for 2025

- Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Start contributing to open-source projects
- Build a personal website/portfolio
- Improve my Git and GitHub skills

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a friendly chat!
